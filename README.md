# BST 260 EHR Project
- This is a final project for the Fall 2017 course in [Data Science I](http://datasciencelabs.github.io/) (BST 260) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) on the Use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in the United States by 2016.
- Group members are [Katherine Wang](https://github.com/katwang/), [Lauren Yoo](https://github.com/jmybhm), and [Eunice Yeh](https://github.com/euniceyeh/).
- The complete final analysis report can be found in the repository linked [here](https://github.com/euniceyeh/EHR-Project). It compiles into one [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), which can be viewed online [here](https://euniceyeh.github.io/EHR-Project/) or you can view the html files under `/docs` in the repository first linked (we recommend starting with `index.html` and prepending the URL with `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?`).
- All analysis-ready R datasets are stored in `/data`.
- A summary and visual presentation of our main findings can be found on this repository, which is built for our [project website](https://katwang.github.io/BST-260-Final-Project-Site/) and also includes our screencast.
- The main objective of our project is to understand the relationship of EHR use with eligible providers, both physicians (EPs) and hospitals, in the [2016 Medicare & Medicaid EHR Incentive Program](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/2016ProgramRequirements.html) across the United States. We also explore the demographics of both provider types by geographical regions and by EHR vendors as our secondary objectives.

Hope you enjoy our project!
