# Overview

## Background and Motivation

In the past 10 years, there has been a lot of discussion around the benefits and risks of adopting electronic health records (EHR's). Many news sources have covered the topic, and multiple government agencies have published recommendations and articles on the adoption of EHR's. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services initiated the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Inventive Programs to encourage medical professionals to adopt EHR technology. From 2008 to 2015, the number of office-based practitioners with EHR systems doubled, proving that the popularity of EHR's are only increasing (https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/physician-ehr-adoption-trends.php).

## Project Objectives

Since EHR's are a technology-based implementation, our group wanted to see if younger physicans are more likely to adopt EHR technology. What are some of the factors that might be associated with adoptation of EHR's? Additionally, we know that physicians working in hospitals do not have a choice in adopting EHR's. As a result, we wanted to see if there were hospital-related factors affecting adoption of EHRs. 

We looked at hospital and phys data from 2016

The following terms were defined as follows from our dataset:

> * Physicians adopted a Basic EHR if they reported their practice performed all of the following computerized functions: patient demographics, patient problem lists, electronic lists of medications taken by patients, clinician notes, orders for medications, viewing laboratory results, and viewing imaging results. The core capabilities of a Basic EHR were defined by DesRoches, et al. in the 2008 manuscript.
> * Any EHR system is a medical or health record system that is either all or partially electronic, and excludes systems solely for billing.
> * Data include non-federal, office-based physicians, and exclude radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists.
> * A certified EHR system is one that meets the requirements adopted by the US Department of Health and Human Services.
